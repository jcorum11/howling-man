 A lottery outlet. To enter, you have to put a GP into above the doorknob. You walk in and bells go off - you're a winner!! A crowd cheers around you and you see then number 10,000 person. A sash is placed on you. You're the 10,000th customer! You win a large cash prize! Congratulations! You can either stop now, or take the chance to double or nothing your earnings!! The shop has a large prize wheel. Roll a D10 - anything other than a D10 loses! You just have to sign here and pay the deposit of 10 gold coins! If the PC does so, they earn the prize of 1,000 gold coins. They check their pouch and a faint golden vapor is leaving their pouch and moves toward the lottery. If they re-enter, they must pay another coin, but the building is empty.
