# Finy Tower

## Royal family 

Elwel: 
Male Elf Paladin, Good. Str 11, Dex 10, Con 11, Int 6, Wis 16, Cha 14. 
Elwel has a square face, with gray hair and brown eyes. He wears Fine Leather armor and wields a scimitar. Of late Elwel has seemed to age many years past his time because of the war that has been brought to his front gates. The past few ten years he has lost family members, seen too many of his people die, and the war seems to have no end in sight. He is eager for this war to be over and willing to aid anyone wishing to put a stop to it. His greatest lament of all is seeing in the city children who know no other life than war. 

Laeda: Female Elf Assassin, Evil. 
Laeda, the spouse of Elwel, is tall, with silver hair and light hazel eyes. She wears leather armor and wields a poisoned club. 
Laeda, at the beginning of the war, sought to delve into magic so that she could better help build the wall that would help protect their family. Among her studies she stumbled upon lycanthropy and began to study the origins of the dark art. She saw the power that would come from it and believed that she could control it enough to be of great aid in the war. She found a way to curse herself but the curse consumed her. She preys on her own people in the night, a pastime that is perfect for the current situation given the war claims many lives. She killed her own daughter by accident will trying to assassinate her husband so that she could have greater rule over her people to feast. 

Lene: Female Elf Fighter, Neutral. Lene was repulsive in appearance, with black hair and brown eyes. She was known for her banded mail and her military fork. Lene was fascinated by geometry. Her death was blamed on an assassin devil that tried to kill Elwel, but it was not a demon but Laeda in werewolf form.

Baleue: Female Elf Wizard, Good. Baleue has brown hair and light amber eyes, and prominent ears. She wears modest garments and wields a quarterstaff and dagger. Baleue has an arcane familiar, a silver cat which can generate tiny bolts of lightning. She is sceptical of her mother, saying that she has become aggressive in the past years and having studied magic herself in her upbringing sees the books that her mother reads. 

Brytha: Female Elf Artist, Neutral. Brytha is exceptionally beautiful, with white hair and gray eyes. She wears tailored clothing and an ermine fur cape. Brytha is indifferent to what goes on around her, except that her options for friends are dwindling. She prefers to paint than aid in the war effort and is merely waiting for it to end so she can return to the carefree life of her childhood.
