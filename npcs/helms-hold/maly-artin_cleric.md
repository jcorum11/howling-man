As a part of her upbringing by an apothecary Maly is fascinated by ghosts and spirits.

She no longer cares about what people do or say, she believes that this people deserve to die at the hands of the devils. 

She has been following the king since she has a sense for his whereabouts by a spiritual mark that she has kept on his clothes.

She follows him the night that he takes the players with him to feed the people. 

Because of this she begins to question her motives. 

She does know of the coatl and decide to help the players in their quest.

She tells the king of the coatl and the war between them and the devils.

She knows as well that there is a coatl trapped in Tamochoan and tells him to let them leave and to aid them.
