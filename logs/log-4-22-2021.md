The companions spent the night at Aryn's before heading for the mire. They were awoken early dawn by a thud and scratching at the front door, and upon opening it found the undead, now redead, body of Marin. There was what appeared to be a floating blood stain outside the house at town square, and the adventurers decided to investigate. The floating blood stain was actually a blood-soaked invisibility cloak that had been lain over the severed head of <insert lady's name here>. Three barbed devils and five imps appeared and rushed toward the companions, when Aryn created a wall of plasma blocking the devils and summoned celestial horses and the group took off to the south toward Helm's Hold. Upon their arrival they slowly decided upon a course of action. Siniša would sneak through the swamp and fire an arrow over the walls with a note containing the symbol of the god of winter solstice and a request to be let inside the walls. After a successful slink through the swamp, Siniša successfully fired an arrow with a note over the wall, only to realize he'd forgotten to write anything other than the symbol. He quickly wrote another note with an actual message and sent it over as well. A note was returned stating a rope would be lowered for only five minutes at midnight exactly. After rejoining his companions and relaying the message, Siniša and the others were graciously granted temporary invisibility by Leo for a quick trip through the swamp where they awaited the rope. When it was lowered they began their ascent, making it to the top where they were greeted by guards before being escorted to the tower where the family in charge was.
