the party started off in an inn called the Lazy Maiden. there they met the inn keeper, an abrasive man named Ralphye. They tried many times to make friends with him without success, Leo even playing for the inn but met with a cold sholder. He was finally intimidated by Gavinrad's fancy dress and mannerisms, and then was spooked by Sinisha's thurmaturgy where Sinisha made himself larger and asked for a drink. They were given free rooms to sleep for the night and were told to meet Mera at her pewter shop in town square. After that Ralphye avoided the party for the rest of the night.

Sinisha was sold by Leo as an escourt to a gnomish woman and slept with her for the night. The rest of the party slept and the next morning they made their way over to Meras shop called Resby's Pewter. There they met Mera, a kind woman who is an alchemist and sells jewelry and kitchenware in her shop. She gave them information about some of the happenings in Neverwinter, including talk of an overthrow of the Lord Dagult Neverember by the Sons of Alagondor, and the dissaperance of the Lord and his right hand man Fingolai. She also spoke of devils and demons in the streets. 

Sinisha attempted to take a black perl from off the desk of Mera but Mera had a quick eye and caught him in the act. When Leo asked about her ability to use Alchemy she showed them the spirit of the silver dragon that posessed her. They asked her how this came to be and she directed them to yet another shop next door called Reda's Masonry where they were to meet a woman named Arran. They made their way in that direction and they spoke to Arran who asked them to stop by that night. That night they returned and Arran told them of the adventure that she and Mera had, how after the eruption of Mount Hotenow the city was in ruins and the people of Neverwinter needed an Alchemist. She was an adventurer and had heard of a silver dragon that would be able to grant her that power. The old dragon was dying and the spirit of the dragon posessed her. The party then asked her if she had any further information about what was going on in the city. She then cast Zone of Truth on the party, Gavinrad in turn cast zone of truth on her. She asked if they had intentions to harm her or Neverwinter. They replied that they didn't and that in fact that they wanted to help. She told them that she is a member of the now disbanded Many-Starred Cloak who are a group of wizards, the group that Fingolai was a member of. She suspected that Fingolai was unintentionally responsible for the presence of the devils and demons in the land and that he was under some sort of mind control when he reopened the crag from which the demons where coming from. 

Mera then told them of a way to help seal the crag, by going to the Shrine of Tamochoan to find a Choatl to help them seal it. They were warned of how dangerous it would be. On their way out the party found a package on the doorstep addressed to Sinisha. It was for his travels and inside was the black perl. it was discovered to have the ability to charm anyone toward the person attuned with it. 

The group went to get supplies for the journey and there this log ends
