The group started off intoxicated at their celebration of Oakhurst being liberated from the bearded devil that had enslaved them. They enjoyed the festivities for some time and then Sinisa and Gavinrad step off the intoxication while Leo stayed up and partied through the night. The group had been summoned to the house of Hercule to discuss some matters. They went to their home early the next morning. Just before this Sinisa drank some potion that turned him partly into a bird from the Alchemist. The group were informed by Kerowyn that she had been receiving disturbing commands from Neverwinter and that she would like them to go to Neverwinter to see what had happened to the leadership there. She also gave Gavinrad a message from his family. His brother had been killed by the devils and the other was in hiding, and that the devils were looking for him. He told Leo of this and the group decided that they would continue to Neverwinter despite this news. They then went to the mill to find some horses, which were given to them as long as they carried a load of logs to Neverwinter. They were also warned that they would need to find Coatl to seal the crag that was spewing demons from it since the Coatl were the ones that were able to do it before. They traveled to Ubbin Falls where they went to an in called the Inn of a thousand names. They did not think this would be a good place to stay the night so they went to The wyvern’s keep. There the found a luck potion where Sinisa drank his and had incredible luck. They went to the castle at Ubbin Falls where they were met by Bilgia, the reeve of the town. She signed to Sinisa in thieve’s cant that they were to meet at the teleportation circle. Sinisa found a map in his pocket later that showed him the location of the circle. Bilgia permitted them to stay at the castle. Later that night there was a knock on the door, standing outside of their room was a large man. Upon second look he had turned into a busty barmaid who tried to seduce Sinisa. The party found out with a spell of truth that her name was Beazerus, that she was trying to get the map from him and that she was a succubus. Sinisa slit her throat and the group made their way to the teleportation circle. There Bilgia met them under cover of a cloak of invisibility. She told them that a devil resided there that had taken control of the city and that the people had began to enjoy worshiping Asmodeus. She told them that the best help that they could be to them was to rid Neverwinter of the devils that occupied it. She also told them that she would take care of their cargo and that the teleportation circle would take them directly to Neverwinter. The group decided to trust her and use the portal. The campaign ended as they said the key word to make the portal work and found themselves and Neverwinter town square.
