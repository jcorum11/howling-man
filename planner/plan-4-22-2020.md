- group will need to find shelter for the night, Arran will let them stay the night. She believes it is not safe for them to be travelling at night. 

- because of the spells that Arran put on her shop it keeps the devils from finding the party that night. 

- in the morning they will be greeted by an undead Mera (the lady who gave the pearl to Sinisa)

- Arran will warn that this is terrorism from the devils, they wish to draw them out of her home

- if the group goes outside they will find that no one is at town square

- group will find a splatter of blood waiving in the air low to the ground. 

- upon touching it will find that it is a cloak of some sort. 

- when pulled off the party will find that it is the head of Bilgia on a pike, eyes and mouth sewn shut and the name Buvalu branded into her cheeks. In the locks of her hair is pinned a note written in blood "there you are"

- they will then be attacked by imps and spined devils who will try to capture them

- Arran will create a wall between them and the feinds and try to escape with them via horseback

- if they are captured they will be taken to the castle to a spined devil named Bulva, the devil who rules over Ubbin Falls, and a Pit Feind called Gal. They will interrogate and torture them and then escourt them to the other side of the crag and drag them to Baazal where they will be tortured and turned into devils. 

- if they escape they Arran will guide them to Helm's Hold where they could find refuge. 

- the devils give chase with the same band of barbed devils and imps and the players must travel through the night or be captured and dragged back to Neverwinter. 

- Helm's Hold has been under seige for the past 10 years, but only recently have the devils sent massive numbers of demons and devils alike to try to overrun Helm's hold. Arran sends carrier pigeon as they ride to helm's hold and that it is imperitive that they let the players through. 

- on the hope that they will get through, they plow through the demons and devils that are swarming the wall of helm's hold, through the rain of arrows, and up to the gate. 

- the players must defend Arran as she uses concentration to create a wall of force, kill any devils or demons that are inside the wall, then pass through the gate. 

- Once inside they meet the king of Helm's Hold Elwel in his tower. They meet the Finy family and they are asked to explain themselves

- Elwel is willing to help the party get to the Shrine and navigate the Mere of Dead men

- He gives them a map of the mere that indicates their location at all times 

- He asks Arran to stay to help defend the city. She agrees to stay considering that she could be of better help there. 

- The party will then leave the city through the back entrance directly into the mere and travel a half day to the Shrine.
