She is a werewolf.

Constantly eats rare steaks to supplement her need for blood

The war has been good for her as her appetite is growing.

Her secret is that she cheated on her husband with a man that turned her into a werewolf. 

She asked to be turned into a werewolf since she believed that she would be taken away from Helm's hold, but was forced to put her lover to death when her infedelity was nearly discovered.

She was nearly discovered by Fingolai who read a crystal ball where he saw that Helm's Hold would fall because of her infidelity. 

For this she resents her husband.
