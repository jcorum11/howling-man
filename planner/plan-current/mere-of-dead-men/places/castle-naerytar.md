## Castle Naerytar

It served as the base of operations of the Academy of Stargazers in the 14th century DR and as an outpost of the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15th century DR.

The castle was located around two days' travel from the Western edge of the Mere of Dead Men. The surroundings were difficult to traverse, as the terrain was muddy and temperatures were cold within the swamp.

The castle's top floor housed an observatory that contained a magical telescope known as the farseer of Illusk, which could be used for both astronomical and ground observations. The device had been installed by the Academy of Stargazers, but fell in disuse after their disappearance. By the late 15th century DR, it had become difficult to operate as a result of poor maintenance.
