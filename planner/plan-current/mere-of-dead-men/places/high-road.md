## The High Road

The High Road was an inland trade route along the Sword Coast North that stretched from Waterdeep in the south to Luskan in the north. For travelers, it was the key route linking Waterdeep and Leilon with "civilization" in the North.

At its southernmost point, the High Road entered Waterdeep, where it passed through the city as one of its most important streets and continued south as the Trade Way. Hence, some accounts referred to the Trade Way as part of the High Road. The adjoining Long Road separated from the High Road a dozen miles (20 kilometers) north of Waterdeep.

From the North Gate of Waterdeep, it skirted Thornhold and the eastern edge of the Mere of Dead Men where it passed beneath Iniarv's Tower and beside the Sword Mountains, before going through Leilon. Shortly afterward, it intersected with the western Triboar Cutoff then went through Neverwinter and Port Llast before coming to Luskan. It was roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) between Leilon and Neverwinter and 35 miles (56 kilometers) between Neverwinter and Port Llast.
