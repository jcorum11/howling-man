- start at the wall of Helm's deep

- will be shackled and taken to the dungeon

- will be visited by the king with his many guards, the note they shot over the wall with him.  

- king asks where they learned about the symbol

- depending on the answer the king with decide whether they are spies or not, they will know that he is using a spell to tell whether they are lying or not

- if they are not found truthful or for any reason the king finds them untrustworthy they will have to find another means to get out of the dungeon

- if they succeed in convincing the king they will be taken to Finy tower where they will meet with the king. 

- at this meeting they will be questioned about their motives. 

- he nor his advisors, historians, religious people, or magicians know nothing about the ancient war between the coatl and the devils and do not make the connection between how plundering Tamochoan will help the realm. 

- the king will be disappointed that they are not meant to help directly with their war effort. 

- he does not know where Tamochoan is, neither does his historian, nor his geographer, other than that it is rumored to be somewhere in the mire and that the mire is far too dangerous to simply search for it. 

- that night the king will take them out to the town where he will help the people by breaking bread for them. 

- It will be reminiscent of Christ by the way he multiplies bread and fish for them. 

- secretly Maly Artyn will follow and this incident will make her believe that they do have a chance of winning the war.


- the king will beg them to help with his war effort. 

- he promises that the will provide men and resources to scourge the mire for the dungeon. 

- if they disagree the next day the king will learn from Maly that the coatl are celestial beings and it is rumored that there is one in Tamochoan. He will help them prepare to find the dungeon by giving them supplies. 

- if they agree the next day the party go to meet with Maly and her clerics at the chapel who have been able to reinforce the walls with their divine power but they look exhausted, they have nearly spent their efforts to protect the city. 

- either way, Arran offers support with a powerful item, a hoop that when a group holds together in prayer their god will make their walls impenetrable for as long as they can hold it (usually about 3 days)

- That night, while the players are in the chapel with Maly 

- On the horizon will come a devil dressed in bright robes being lead by a guard through the ranks of the army. 

- He stops nearly a quarter of a mile from the wall and the ranks clear the space between him and the wall. He spews floods of darkness toward the city wall and, with a thunderous crack, it erupts. 

- Arran will save the city with the group of clerics by holding the steel hoop with them which, when held in their hands, the sacred wall glows with celestial power. 

- The group must hold the ring still at chest level, they will be able to do this for approximately three days before they will lose harmony from sleep deprevation. 

- As the ring moves up so does the wall's celestial barrier and the demons will be able to get underneath it. If it moves down the demons can fly over or get their ladders over. 

- Elwel, a powerful magician himself, will urge them to leave to find the coatl and save the city. 

- The cartographer Mantie will be by the king's side, he will instruct her to go with the party. She has a crude map of where she thinks the shrine might be.

- she believes that it is under Uth Tower in the kingdom of Uth who reside in the Mere.

- she is a powerful magician (lvl 5), that will continue with them through the dungeon. 

- Elwel magically opens a dimension door through the city, breaking the teleportation seal of the city for a moment, the players will see through the portal after they enter a chain devil appears inside the city and drags the king into a portal to the underworld.

- The devils will search for them if they do not get away from the castle immediately. 

- If they do not manage to get away they will encounter a chain devil who will take them into the nine hells where they will be thrown in the bottom most pit and they must start at the bottom and make their way to the top of the 9 hells to escape. 

- it will take two days to make it to Uth Tower where they hope to meet the dwarves that used to live there to help them find the shrine

- along their way they will meet a half-ogre, a cockatrice, and 5 shriekers a hunter that is out gathering food for his tribe that has the shriekers placed so that no one can steal his food. He figures that if he can kill the party his hunt can be over.

- If the party succeeds in persuading the ogre to let them go and provide them rations, he will also give them a powerful tool for their quest, a wistle that gives advantage on all checks against the undead that can be used 3 times called  Gallarhorn 

- he underestimates their ability, his overconfidence will be his weakness

- when they find the tower they will believe that it is nearly abandoned, they will go inside and meet cultists and eventually a young bronze dragon if they do not find the shrine in time.

- if the players attempt to free the dragon, the dragon will be grateful and lend them some scales that can be made into very strong armor, it will help them in their journey as well by transforming into a human wizard and helping them with their fight. 

- if not they must find the shrine on their own. 

- the shrine will be deep under the tower, barracaded by the cultists so that no one enters.
