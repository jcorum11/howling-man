## plan for 5-13-2020

### Helm's Hold

Upon arrival the players were questioned by the guards. After proving that they are on a noble errand they are sent to Finy tower, the army general, who the players have impressed, takes them to the barraks where they are to wait until the evening when the war council will get together to gather intel about the war effort. There they can rest and replenish themselves. They are given rations and are offered to have any weapons, clothes, or tools mended. 

That evening they will join the meeting where they will be introduced to King Elwel. He will be pleased to have them in Finy tower. When they go they are introduced to the royal family and are permitted to eat dinner with them. They get a suspicious feeling from the lady of the house. She eats rare steak ravenously, she talks poorly of the people of the city and talks down to her husband who she knows has been sneaking away at night despite the danger of a king being outside the tower especially during wartime. 

That night the noble king will knock on their door. dressed as a beggar and under a hood he will ask them to dress likewise and they will steal away into the night to help thechildren and families who have lost their fathers and are living on the streets. They will see the king hand gold coins to children and give the old bread and help heal the sick. 

If players ask how they can help the war effort, Elwel will respond that they can help the clerics, whom he will introduce to them the following day. Either this or Elwel will bring it up himself.

The next day the party go to meet with the clerics who have been able to reinforce the walls with their divine power but they look exhausted, they have nearly spent their efforts to protect the city. Arran offers support with powerful item, a hoop that when a group holds together in prayer to their god will make their walls impenetrable for as long as they can hold it (usually about 3 days)

That night, while the players are in the chapel with one of the clerics (the chapel has been turned into a tower that can oversee the wall), players will see the city almost fall. On the horizon will come a devil dressed in bright robes being lead by a guard through the ranks of the army. He stops nearly a quarter of a mile from the wall and the ranks clear the space between him and the wall. He spews floods of darkness toward the city wall and, with a thunderous crack, it erupts. 

Arran will save the city with the group of clerics by holding a steel hoop with them which, when held in their hands, the sacred wall glows with celestial power. The group must hold the ring still at chest level, they will be able to do this for approximately three days before they will lose harmony from sleep deprevation. As the ring moves up so does the wall's celestial barrier and the demons will be able to get underneath it. 

Elwel, a powerful magician himself, will urge them to leave to find the coatl and save the city. He magically opens a dimension door through the city, breaking the the teleportation seal of the city for a moment, the players will see through the portal after they enter a chain devil appears inside the city and drags the king into a portal to the underworld.
