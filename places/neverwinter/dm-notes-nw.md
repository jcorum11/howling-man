## Neverwinter Notes
Neverwinter is in a state if entire destruction for multiple reasons
1. the recent eruption of Mount Hotenow and the efforts to rebuild by Lord Neverember
2. the dethroning and dissappearence of Lord Neverember and Fingoli
3. the brief return of Fingoli and the re-opening of the crag by Fingoli and the following destruction of the Archanist's Quarter
4. the demons and devils occupying the Archanist's Quarter

Neverwinter government used to be ruled by Lord Dagult Neverember with Fingolai, a member of the reformed Many-Starred Cloak, as his right hand man. Then Fingolai accidentally ripped a hole in this plane and punctured a hole directly into the Nine Hells. After being overwhelmed by devils, Fingolai led a coo of the remnants of the Sons of Alagondar to overthrow the throne who were successful. Then it was seen that A man in a crimson robe (Asmodeus) reopened the crag, destroying the Archanist's Quarter. Since then the remains of the people of Neverwinter have not seen Fingolai or Lord Neverember, nor any of the Many-Starred Cloak. In fact, the people are correct about this, a Barbed Devil resides in the castle who is manipulating the Sons. The Sons of Alagondar have been seen in Castle Neverwinter but not outside, it is question by the people whether or not they are actually in power as the beliefs that they promoted are not being upheld, nor do they seem to make any movements in government. Government has been largely absent except for the Graycloaks Militia who protect the people from the Demons that now come from the Crag. Devils have guarded the Crag and their movements seem to be that they are herding Demons from the crag into a portal that is assumed to be to the Nine Hells.

The town is actually ruled by a Barbed Devil named Sin-Gasit with two imps
