## Stoneshaft Hold

A keep located on a hill that was located to the west of the High Road and just beyond the southern border of the Mere of Dead Men.

Used to be called Thornhold

The keep was situated a short way from the top of a hill whose west side dropped off into a seaside cliff. 

Thornhold was a plain gray stone fort that comprised a central keep and two towers. Its walls featured no decorations, only evenly-spaced arrow slits set upon its façade with battlements set atop.

There were rumors that said that the caves beneath Thornhold held a passageway that led down to the depths of the Underdark. While true, the existence of these caves were largely kept secret by the dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft.
