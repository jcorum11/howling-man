## Uthtower

The name Uthtower was applied to both the kingdom of Uthtower founded by Uth Myrmoran and the tower he built and declared his seat of power in 146 DR.[1]

The structure known as Uthtower was constructed by Uth I in 146 DR as the literal seat of power of his newly formed kingdom. It stood on a rocky pinnacle overlooking the coastal town below.[1]

The tower stood nearly 70’ tall and was 40’ in diameter with a rectangular gatehouse attached on its western face. There were three stories in the tower and catacombs below connected by a central spiral staircase. The ground floor housed guards and the armory. The middle floor contained the throne room, council room, and kitchen. The third floor was where the monarch and his family had their private chambers including bedrooms and a library. The catacombs served as cellars and crypts for the royal family as well as the seven other noble families of the region.[1]

After the creation of the Mere of Dead Men and the fall of the kingdom in 615 DR, the tower stood abandoned. That is until a black dragon by the name of Chardansearavitriol, also known as Ebondeath, made the tower and catacombs his lair in 685 DR. Just as the Mymoran family ruled the land, so did Chardansearavitriol rule the swamp from the tower for centuries. In 922 DR Chardansearavitriol succumbed to the influence of Strongor Bonebag and the Cult of the Dragon and was transformed into a dracolich. The tower was also converted into a temple to Myrkul, renamed the Mausoleum of Ebondeath, and was occupied by the Ebondeath sect to serve the dracolich until his inevitable ascension.[1]

The sect witnessed what they deemed Ebondeath’s second stage of ascension to Ossavitor’s Way in 1202 DR when his bones crumbled to dust upon an altar to Myrkul in the catacombs. The influence of the sect grew as more worshipers flocked to the hidden temple. They continued their work toward Ebondeath’s further ascension until the end of the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR. Upon Myrkul’s death at that time, the tower and catacombs sank into the swamp drowning many of the cultists.[1]

The Uthtower remained below the waters of the Mere until 1372 DR when an astronomical event known as the Eye of Myrkul once again occurred and three rings of Myrkul were brought close to the tower. The waxing power of Myrkul caused the tower and catacombs to rise from the swamp and drain the filthy waters from it. The Uthtower only remained above the surface until the event passed, at which point it sank back below the marsh, possibly for good.[1]
